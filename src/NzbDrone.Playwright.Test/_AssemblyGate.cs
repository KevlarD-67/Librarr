    // default `dotnet test` invocation in a dev sandbox doesn't have a built
    // binary on hand and may not have Playwright's browser bundle installed,
    // so we don't fail it by default — opt in with READARR_RUN_PLAYWRIGHT=1.
    //
    // First-run setup: see README.md for the `playwright install` step.
    //
    // The browser and the Librarr instance live HERE, not on the test base,
    // and this is load-bearing. NzbDroneRunner.KillAll() kills every Readarr
    // process by name rather than only its own, and every fixture wants port
    // 8787 — so with per-fixture lifecycles, one fixture's teardown would
    // shoot down another fixture's instance and the suite failed
    // intermittently with TargetClosedException from OneTimeSetUp. One
    // instance per assembly removes the race by construction, and boots once
    // instead of once per fixture.
