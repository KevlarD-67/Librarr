    // re-ranked (#15) and each one carries a work count (#28) so a stub record
    // can be told apart from the real author at a glance.
    //
    // Until now that was covered by vitest against a mocked store, plus a
    // by-hand browser check. The vitest side proves the component renders a
    // count it was handed; it cannot prove the API hands one over, which is
    // the half that actually broke during #24 (work counts came back 0 on the
    // id path, so a correct match was labelled "No works").
    //
    // This talks to real OpenLibrary. It is the one fixture here that does, so
    // it degrades to Inconclusive rather than red when the network is missing.
