.SYNOPSIS
    Authenticode-sign Librarr's Windows binaries and installers.

.DESCRIPTION
    Signs the first-party executables and assemblies produced by the build --
    Readarr.exe, Readarr.Console.exe, Readarr.Update.exe and the Readarr.*.dll
    set -- plus any installer .exe passed directly.

    Third-party dependencies are deliberately left alone. Re-signing someone
    else's binary with our certificate asserts that we published it, which is
    not true, and most of them already carry their vendor's signature.

    With no certificate configured this exits 0 after saying so. That is the
    point: a fork without a code-signing certificate should still be able to
    cut a release, it just ships unsigned binaries. Once a certificate IS
    configured, any failure to sign is fatal -- quietly publishing unsigned
    artifacts from a pipeline that claims to sign them is the worse outcome.

.PARAMETER Path
    Files and/or directories to sign. Directories are searched recursively for
    the first-party patterns above; files are signed as given.

.PARAMETER CertificateBase64
    Base64-encoded PKCS#12 (.pfx). Defaults to $env:WINDOWS_CERT_PFX.
    Base64 because GitHub Actions secrets are text.

.PARAMETER CertificatePassword
    Password for that .pfx. Defaults to $env:WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD.

.PARAMETER TimestampUrl
    RFC3161 timestamp authority. A timestamp is what keeps signatures valid
    after the signing certificate expires, so this is not optional.

    ./distribution/windows/sign.ps1 -Path _artifacts

# Keep this file pure ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less script as

# actual character. pwsh 7 (what CI runs) decodes UTF-8 correctly and never
# sees this, so it only breaks for whoever runs the script locally.
